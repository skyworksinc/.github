Title:
Be sure to update the title to a descripitive name.
- Start the title with a verb (e.g. Change header styles)
- Use the imperative mood in the title (e.g. Fix, not Fixed or Fixes header styles)
- Use labels wisely

Considerations:
- Documentation: How should this be documented?
- Testing: How should this be tested?
- Error and Warning Handling: What problems might be encountered?  How should these be handled?
